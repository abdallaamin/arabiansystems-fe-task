# Next.js Car Search App

This is a Next.js application that allows users to search for cars using an external API. Please note that I understand my solution may not exactly meet all the requirements as requested. I used an API from Rapid API that provides car data, and I implemented all the requested functionality based on this API response. Instead of "vehicles data," I used the car data from the external API.

The reason for this approach is that I had a very tight timeline and limited resources to work with. Additionally, I had a similar app with the logic for fetching and displaying data from this specific car API, which allowed me to implement the solution more efficiently given the time constraints. ( you can check my similar app that i already built with all the needed functionality on ("nextjscarhub.vercel.app/")[nextjscarhub.vercel.app/] )

I want to apologize for not being able to fulfill all the requirements of that task as originally specified. I did my best to deliver a working solution that incorporated most of the requested features. Unfortunately, due to urgent family events and the launch of a an urgent large project at work , I had very limited time and could not even find time even for enough sleep.

I hope you understand that I made the best use of the resources available to me at this time. I appreciate your understanding and hope to hear from you soon.
